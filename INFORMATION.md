# Java Library System

## Description

A repository designed, in Java, to create dynamic arrays, as opposed to the conventional static arrays. Dynamic arrays mimic the `ArrayList` generic class, though the latter is more efficient with memory consumption.

## Contents

### JAVA FILES

- [x] `Numbers.java`: A class that creates a dynamic array
- [x] `Main.java`: The driver class

## Usage

The repository is openly available to whomever wishes to clone and improve upon it. I would kindly ask if you could submit pull requests for your improvements so that everyone can access such enhancements.
